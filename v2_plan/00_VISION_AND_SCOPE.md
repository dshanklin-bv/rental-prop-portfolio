# Vision and Scope
## Real Estate Portfolio Management System

### Problem Statement
Real estate investors managing multiple properties struggle with fragmented tools and spreadsheets that don't provide the portfolio-level insights needed for strategic decision-making. Current solutions either focus on single-property analysis or lack the comparative tools needed to evaluate acquisition opportunities, track performance trends, and optimize portfolio allocation.

**Key Pain Points:**
- No consolidated view of portfolio health and performance
- Difficulty comparing potential acquisitions side-by-side  
- Manual tracking of key dates (lease renewals, loan maturities, inspections)
- Lack of early warning systems for DSCR violations or vacancy spikes
- Time-consuming scenario analysis for refinancing and disposition decisions

### Vision Statement
**"To be the primary decision-support tool for real estate investors, turning complex portfolio data into clear, actionable insights that drive profitable investment decisions."**

### Target Audience

**Primary User: The Growth-Focused Investor**
- Individual investors with 2-20 properties 
- Small real estate syndicates or family offices
- Active investors acquiring 2-4 properties per year
- Seeking to optimize existing portfolio while evaluating new opportunities

**Technical Profile:**
- Comfortable with web applications but not necessarily technical
- Currently using Excel/Google Sheets with some QuickBooks or property management software
- Values data accuracy over automation complexity
- Needs mobile-friendly access for on-the-go property evaluations

### High-Level Goals

#### 1. Portfolio Intelligence
- Provide consolidated dashboard showing total equity, cash flow, and performance trends
- Enable geographic and performance-based property comparison
- Track key portfolio metrics (blended cap rate, aggregate DSCR, occupancy rates)

#### 2. Acquisition Pipeline Management  
- Side-by-side comparison of potential properties with standardized underwriting
- Deal pipeline tracking from sourcing through closing
- Scenario modeling for different financing structures

#### 3. Proactive Asset Management
- Early warning alerts for DSCR violations, lease expirations, loan maturities
- Performance tracking against projections with variance analysis
- Capital event modeling (refinancing, major capex, disposition)

#### 4. Decision Support Analytics
- Waterfall visualizations showing cash flow breakdowns
- Sensitivity analysis showing impact of key variable changes
- Time-based performance trends and forecasting

### Success Metrics
- **User Adoption:** Users actively manage 5+ properties in the system
- **Decision Velocity:** 50% reduction in time to evaluate new acquisitions  
- **Financial Accuracy:** IRR calculations within ±5 basis points of Excel models
- **Proactive Management:** 80% of critical dates (lease renewals, loan maturities) flagged 90+ days in advance

### Out of Scope (Non-Goals)

**V2 Will NOT Include:**
- ❌ Property accounting/bookkeeping (rent collection, expense categorization)
- ❌ Tenant communication or lease management workflows
- ❌ Property management software integrations (AppFolio, Buildium, etc.)
- ❌ Document storage beyond basic file attachments
- ❌ Team collaboration or multi-user access controls
- ❌ Market data feeds or automated valuation models
- ❌ Tax preparation or depreciation schedule generation
- ❌ Construction/renovation project management

**Rationale:** Focus on investment analysis and portfolio oversight, not operational property management. This maintains clear boundaries and prevents feature creep while delivering high-value decision support tools.

### Competitive Positioning
**vs. Excel/Sheets:** Purpose-built interface with portfolio-level intelligence and automated calculations
**vs. BiggerPockets Calculator:** Multi-property portfolio management and ongoing performance tracking  
**vs. Stessa/RentSpree:** Investment analysis focus rather than operational management
**vs. Enterprise Solutions:** Designed for individual investors, not large institutional portfolios

### Key Differentiators
1. **Local-First Architecture:** No vendor lock-in, complete data control
2. **Portfolio-Centric Design:** Built for managing multiple properties, not single-asset analysis
3. **Decision-Focused Interface:** Every feature supports acquisition, management, or disposition decisions
4. **Accuracy Over Automation:** Manual data input accepted in exchange for bulletproof calculations
