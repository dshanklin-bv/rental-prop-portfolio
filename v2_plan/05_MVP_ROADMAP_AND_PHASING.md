# MVP Roadmap & Phasing Strategy

## Phased Development Approach

### Development Philosophy
- **Ship Early, Ship Often**: Deliver value incrementally rather than big-bang releases
- **User Validation First**: Validate core assumptions before building advanced features
- **Technical Debt Management**: Build for current phase while maintaining architectural flexibility
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Use actual usage metrics to guide feature prioritization

### Success Criteria
Each phase has specific measurable outcomes that must be achieved before advancing to the next phase.
