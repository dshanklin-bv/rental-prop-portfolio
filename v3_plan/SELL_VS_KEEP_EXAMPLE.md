# Example Analysis: Sell vs Keep

## Your Situation
- You own a 4-unit building
- Current market value: $500,000
- You bought it for $350,000 three years ago
- Current mortgage balance: $200,000
- Each unit rents for $1,200/month = $4,800 total monthly rent

## The Question
Should you sell now or keep it as a rental for the next 10 years?

## Scenario A: Sell Now
```
Current Market Value:           $500,000
Selling Costs (6%):            -$30,000
Gross Proceeds:                 $470,000
Pay Off Mortgage:              -$200,000
Net Cash Proceeds:              $270,000

Capital Gains Tax:
- Sale Price - Original Cost:   $500,000 - $350,000 = $150,000
- Capital Gains Tax (20%):     -$30,000
After-Tax Proceeds:             $240,000

Invest $240,000 in S&P 500 at 10% annually:
- After 10 years:               $622,458
```

## Scenario B: Keep as Rental
```
Monthly Rental Income:          $4,800
Monthly Expenses:
- Mortgage Payment:             -$1,200
- Property Tax:                 -$500
- Insurance:                    -$200
- Maintenance (5%):             -$240
- Vacancy (5%):                 -$240
Monthly Net Cash Flow:          $2,420

Annual Cash Flow:               $29,040

10-Year Cash Flow Total:        $290,400

Property Appreciation (3% annually):
- Future Value:                 $671,958
- Selling Costs (6%):          -$40,317
- Net Sale Proceeds:            $631,641
- Pay Off Mortgage:            -$150,000 (remaining balance)
- Net Sale Proceeds:            $481,641

Total Return: $290,400 + $481,641 = $772,041
```

## The Answer
**Keep the rental!** 

- **Sell Now**: $622,458 after 10 years
- **Keep Rental**: $772,041 after 10 years
- **Difference**: $149,583 more by keeping

## Key Assumptions to Verify
- Can you actually get $1,200/unit rent?
- Is 3% property appreciation realistic in your market?
- Are the expense estimates accurate?
- Will you actually reinvest stock proceeds and not spend them?

The calculator will let you adjust all these assumptions to see how sensitive the decision is to your inputs.
